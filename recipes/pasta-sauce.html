            </ol>
        <h3>Assembly</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Serve hot over cooked pasta, such as linguini or spaghetti.</li> 
                <li>Recipe can be doubled or tripled and frozen. Cook longer for larger batches.</li>                  
            </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> this recipe is from a friend’s Uncle Rossini. Because tomato sauces made with canned tomatoes tend to be acidic, try adding a 1/4 tsp or more of sugar.</p>                          
        <p>Also, having reviewed a number of popular recipes, many people add between 2-8 tbsp. of extra virgin olive oil depending on the size of the recipe. Some also add a bit of red pepper flakes.</p>
