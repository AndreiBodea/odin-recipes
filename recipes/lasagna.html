    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An easy recipe for one of the best italian dishes!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>0.5kg/1.1 pound ground beef and pork (each).</li>
            <li>ricotta, mozarella and parmezan cheese (quantity depend on how cheesy you want it to be. I used 4 big mozarella balls, 300gr/10.5 ounce of ricotta and about 200gr/7 ounce of parmezan)</li>        
            <li>2 onions></li>        
            <li>2 carrots</li>        
            <li>lasagna sheets or fresh pasta</li>        
            <li>2 cans of crushed tomatoes (in my case, this is about 300gr/10.5 ounce per can)</li>        
            <li>some celery (I hate celery, so I use 2 stalks only)</li>        
            <li>basil</li>        
            <li>red wine</li>        
            <li>garlic, salt, pepper, oil and bay leaf</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I always start by preparing all vegetables: Cut onions into small pieces, carrots into quarters; I cut celery into very big pieces so I can take them out later. If you like celery, you can cut it into small pieces.</li>                
            <li>Add a little oil to a pot and add your ground meat. We are rendering the fat.</li>                
            <li>Once meat is gray in color, turn off heat and drain the liquids into container, we will use this later.</li>                
            <li>    With a bit of fat still in pot, add your onion, carrot, celery and squeeze two or three cloves of garlic through squeezer.</li>                
            <li>Fry vegetables until they give nice smell and create fond on bottom of the pot.</li>                
            <li>Add about 200ml/6.7 ounces (i honestly never measure) red wine to the pot and scrub bottom to deglaze.</li>                
            <li>Allow wine to boil for a bit to evaporate alcohol, and add back your meat to pot.</li>                
            <li>Add the liquid from the meat, two cans of crushed tomatoes and a little bit of water to the pot (I usually add enough to clean the can of the tomatoes). You can also add chicken or beef broth if you have.</li>                
            <li>Add basil, 2 teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon sugar and a bit of ground pepper. (you can also add some chilli flakes or oil to make sauce bit more spicy)</li>
            <li>Let this boil with closed lid, then open lid and let pot simmer for half hour.</li>                
            <li>Make sure to taste the sauce.</li>                
            <li>Optional - take out celery from the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put layer of sauce on bottom of your dish.</li>
            <li>    Put 1 layer of your sheets of lasagna on top.</li>                
            <li> Put layer of sauce on top of the lasagna sheets.</li>                
            <li>  Put a mixture of your cheeses (tear mozarella balls into smaller pieces, ricotta with a spoon and shredded parmezan).</li>                
            <li> Repeat step 2 - 4 until you are out of sauce.</li>                
            <li>  Make sure (I did not have enough cheese when I did this) to have a bunch of shredded parmezan on top of the lasagna, so it forms a "lid" when it melts.</li>                
            <li>  Shove this into preheated oven at 180C/356F for 40 minutes.</li>            
        </ol>
    <p><strong>Important</strong> - Let lasagna rest a bit when you take it out of the oven before you serve.</p>
